# Custom Interactive Interpreter

This is a custom interpreter made by following the youtube tutorial found at [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSmOry4PY0Q).

The interpreter uses Python's builtin functions eval and exec graciously.  They identify between expression and statements.  A generator is used to gather user input lazily.  

To close out of the interpreter type ```exit()```.
